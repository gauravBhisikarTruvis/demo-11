Hi Amit,

The SIT environment is now ready for the early version of Text-to-SQL. We’re looking forward to your feedback so we can update the system and resolve any issues early on.

To-do/Next steps: We are currently working on the SSL certificate configuration. This will be included in the next dev release.
